# GONZALES_BSCS3-4_ADET-Midterm
**Task 1:**
Create 3 environments. 1 for development, 1 for testing & 1 for the production environment.  
## features branch 
This branch is for individual features or bug fixes. Once complete, it gets merged into the development branch.  
## development branch
This is where active development takes place. Once complete, it gets merged into the testing branch.  
## testing branch
Testings will be done in this branch before anything goes live. This is to ensure that everything works the way they supposed to work. When everything is good and final, this branch gets merged into the production branch.  
## production branch 
This is what's going to be live for the users. This serves as the main branch, where users get the updated and stable version.
